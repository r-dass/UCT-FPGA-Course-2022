    INFO: Design contains EBR with ASYNC Reset Mode that has a limitation:
    The use of the EBR block asynchronous reset requires that certain timing
    be met between the clock and the reset within the memory block. 
    See the device specific data sheet for additional details.




    
         
    INFO: Design contains pre-loadable EBR during configuration that has a
         requirement:
    Since the GSR is disabled for the EBR, make sure write enable and chip
    enable are inactive during wake-up, so that the pre-loaded initialization
    values will not be corrupted during wake-up state.

---------

GSR Component:
   The local reset signal 'ipReset_c' of the design has been inferred as Global
        Set Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR control is 'ipReset_c'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
        

     Components on inferred reset domain with GSR Property disabled
--------------------------------------------------------------

     These components have the GSR property set to DISABLED and are on the
     inferred reset domain. The components will respond to the reset signal
     'ipReset_c' via the local reset on the component and not the GSR component.
