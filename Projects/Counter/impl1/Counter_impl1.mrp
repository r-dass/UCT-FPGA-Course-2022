Memory Usage
------------

    
         
    INFO: Design contains EBR with ASYNC Reset Mode that has a limitation:
    The use of the EBR block asynchronous reset requires that certain timing
    be met between the clock and the reset within the memory block. 
    See the device specific data sheet for additional details.
