@W: MT529 :"c:\users\reeve\git\eee5117,8z\projects\counter\counter.v":9:0:9:5|Found inferred clock Counter|ipClk which controls 31 sequential elements including Count[30:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
